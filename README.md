# MyCloset | girlCode x Aritzia Hackathon 2023

### Description

MyCloset is an apparel recommender web application where I contributed on creating the web page that displays previous purchases and recommended apparel. Although our team aimed to implement a simple recommender system using collaborative filtering with mock data, we were unable to complete it within the 24-hour time limit. This project was a valuable opportunity for us to use JavaScript, React, and HTML/CSS for the first time.
